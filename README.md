# ABC Company Analysis  

## Overview 
This project involves analyzing salary expenditures to identify trends and disparities across teams and positions.
Each segment of the code aims to manipulate the dataset, perform analyses, and visualize the results clearly. The process includes loading the data, cleaning it, producing insightful statistics, and visualizing those statistics to better understand the employee distribution, age groupings, financial expenditures, and correlations. This approach will provide a comprehensive view of the dataset.
## Preprocessing Steps  
- Data Loading
- Data Cleaning
- Data Transformation
